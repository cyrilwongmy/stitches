# Stitches: The Needle Pieces together

This repository contains the Needle library homeworks together from [the dlsys course](https://dlsyscourse.org/), a deep learning library designed for educational purposes. This repository is intended to help learners debug and finish the homework assignments in an easy way.

## Homeworks

Each homework without a solution is put into a separate branch and can be accessed by checking out the corresponding branch. The branches are named as follows:
- `hw1`: Homework 1
- `hw2`: Homework 2
- `hw3`: Homework 3
- `hw4`: Homework 4

## Test

Test the autograd module's compute_gradient function using pytest

```
python3 -m pytest -k "compute_gradient"
```
